abstract: |
  ImgStegGAN is a high-performance image steganography system that combines 
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Qwen language model enhancement 
  for secure and efficient hidden message embedding and extraction.
  
  This project is a modified and extended version of SteganoGAN by MIT Data To AI Lab.
